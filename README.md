# Krakow Real Estate Market Dashboard

This project is a Microsoft Power BI dashboard designed for analyzing the Krakow real estate market. Prior to developing the dashboard, a web scraper was used to collect data on properties for sale in Krakow (link), followed by geospatial analysis which included converting address data for geospatial points such as parks, supermarkets, and gyms to latitude and longitude. A Python function was also created to calculate the distance between each property for sale and a given geospatial point, including the distance from the nearest point as well as the number of points within a radius of n kilometers (link). The final product is an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that presents the data in an easy-to-understand manner.
